Scope
-------------

GrainSizeTools (GST) script is primarily targeted at anyone who wants to:

1. Visualize grain size features
2. Obtain a set of single 1D measures of grain size to estimate the magnitude of differential stress (or rate of mechanical work) in dynamically recrystallized rocks (or any other type of crystalline aggregate)
3. Estimate the actual 3D distribution of grain sizes from the population of apparent grain sizes measured in thin sections. This includes the estimation of the volume occupied by a particular grain size fraction and the estimation of the shape of the population of grain sizes (assuming that the distribution of grain sizes follows a lognormal distribution)

The GTS script requires the measurement of the areas of all grain profiles (grain-by-grain) in a thin section as the input. Hence, the script does not apply for determining mean grain sizes via the planimetric (Jeffries) (i.e. the number of grains per unit area) or intercept (the number of grains intercepted by a test line per unit length of test line) procedures. The reasons for using grain-by-grain methods over the planimetric/intercept procedures in rocks are detailed in [Lopez-Sanchez and Llana-Fúnez (2015)](http://www.solid-earth.net/6/475/2015/). The following is an overview of the key assumptions to consider so that the results obtained by the GST script are meaningful and reliable.

### Safety concerns

> All this safety concerns assume that the calibration of the microscope and the scale of the micrographs were set correctly.

#### Getting unidimensional measures of apparent grain size

Unidimensional apparent grain size measures such as the **mean** or **median** are only meaningful in specimens that show a **unimodal distribution of diameters** (or areas). Consequently, it is key to always visualize the distribution of apparent grain sizes and **observe if the distribution is unimodal** (only one peak). In the case that the distribution is multimodal (two or more peaks), you can use for comparative purposes the modal interval or, better, the **location of frequency peaks** [(Lopez-Sanchez and Llana-Fúnez, 2015)](http://www.solid-earth.net/6/475/2015/). Despite this, the best option when a multimodal grain size distribution occurs is to separate the different populations of grain size previously via image analysis methods (i.e. using shape or other parameters). Unfortunately, no general protocol exist in the earth science community for unidimensional grain size measures. Consequently, if apply it is advisable to always report all the different unidimensional grain size measures (mean, median, freq. peak). This will allow other scientists to compare their data with yours directly when using a different type of grain size measurement from that used in your study.

When we estimate unimodal grain size measures from a **single section** (whatever the number of grain boundary maps used), the results will be only meaningful if grains are equant (equiaxed) or near-equant (aspect ratios mostly < 2.0). If grains systematically show aspect ratios above 2.0 and a shape preferred orientation of the large axes throughout the rock volume, you will need to **estimate the grain size over three orthogonal sections and then averaged the results**. Although specimens with equant grains accept any orientation to obtain a unidimensional grain size measure, it is always advisable to use a principal section. Specifically we promote the use of a XZ section, i.e. parallel to the lineation and perpendicular to the foliation, since this will allow us: (i) to visualize and measure whether the grains are far from equant via the aspect ratio; and (ii) to provide a fairer comparison between different specimens when near-equant grains and preferred orientation of the large axes exist.

The common way to estimate a **confidence interval** of your grain size measurement is to take several representative micrographs from the same specimen (three or more) and then estimate the mean and the variation in the results reporting the standard deviation (SD) at a 2-sigma level of confidence, i.e. the confidence interval will be the mean ± two times the SD. To minimize variations in the results due to an insufficient number of grains measurement, a minimum of 433 grains (2-sigma) or 965 (3-sigma) grain areas is required for each grain boundary map (see [Lopez-Sanchez and Llana-Fúnez, 2015)](http://www.solid-earth.net/6/475/2015/) for details).

Lastly, for paleopizometry/paleowattmetry studies **do not report measures derived from distributions estimated via stereological methods but apparent grain size measures**. The reasoning behind this is that stereological methods are built on several (weak) geometric assumptions and the results will always be, at best, only approximate. This means that the precision of the estimated 3D size distribution is **much poorer** than the precision of the original distribution of grain profiles since the latter is based on real data.

#### Getting the shape of actual grain size distribution or the volume occupied by a particular grain size fraction

Estimating the actual grain size distribution from thin sections using stereological methods requires spatial homogeneity and that **grains under study are equant or near-equant**. The Saltykov and two-step methods will not provide reliable results if most of the grains show aspect ratios above 2.0, regardless of whether a shape preference orientation exists or not. In any event, this assumption is acceptable most of the time for some of the most common dynamically recrystallized non-tabular grains in crustal and mantle shear zones, such as quartz, feldspar, olivine and calcite, as well as in ice or metals/alloys. However, be careful when recrystallized grains show very irregular/lobate grain boundaries (i.e. the main recrystallization mechanism was "fast" grain boundary migration).

The Saltykov method is suitable to estimate the volume of a particular grain fraction of interest (in percentage) and to visualize the aspect of the derived 3D grain size distribution using the histogram and a volume-weighted cumulative frequency curve. To provide reliable results, the method requires using a few number of classes and a large number of measurements. *Practical experience* indicates using more than 1000 grains and less than 20 classes. The number of classes has to be set by a trial and error approach. Because of the use of a different number of classes across studies, when estimating the volume of a grain size fraction based on a single grain boundary map always take an absolute error of ± 5 to stay safe (see details in [Lopez-Sanchez and Llana-Fúnez, 2016](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191814116301778)). If possible, take more than one representative grain boundary map and then estimate a confidence interval as explained above in this section.

The two-step method ([Lopez-Sanchez and Llana-Fúnez, 2016](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191814116301778)) is suitable for describing quantitatively the shape of the actual 3D grain size distribution using the MSD (multiplicative standard deviation) parameter, also providing a reliable uncertainty value. This estimate is independent of the chosen number of classes. The method assume that the actual grain size distribution follows a lognormal distribution, **there is therefore critical to visualize the distribution using the Saltykov method first and ensure that the distribution is unimodal and lognormal-like**.
