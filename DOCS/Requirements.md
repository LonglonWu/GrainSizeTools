Requirements
-------------

GrainSizeTools script requires [Python][1] 2.7.x (legacy) or 3.5+ versions and the scientific libraries [*Numpy*][2], [*Scipy*][3], [*Pandas*][9] and [*Matplotlib*][4]. We recommend installing the [Continuum Anaconda][5] or the [Enthought Canopy][6] (maybe more easy-friendly for novices) distributions. Both distributions have free basic versions that include all the required the scientific packages. They also provide free academic licenses for advanced versions. In case you have space problems in your hard disk, there is a distribution named [miniconda][7] that only installs the packages you actually need.

The approach of the script is based on the estimation of the areas of the grain profiles obtained from thin sections. It is therefore necessary to measure them in advance and save the results in a txt/csv file. For this task, we highly encourage you to use the [*ImageJ*](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) application or one of their different flavours (see [here](http://fiji.sc/ImageJ)). These are public-domain image processing programs widely used for scientific research that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This documentation contains a quick tutorial on how to measure the areas of the grain profiles with ImageJ, see the *Table of Contents*. The combined use of **ImageJ** and **GrainSizeTools script** is intended to ensure that all data processing steps are done through free and open-source programs/scripts that run under any operating system.
